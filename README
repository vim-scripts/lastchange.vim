This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=259

this (very) lightweight script automatically updates the time-stamp on a file when you :write it out.
the time-stamp is of the form:
     Last Change: Sat Mar 30 04:00 PM 2002 PST

The script is similar to the example given in :help autocmd, the difference being that the time-stamp already
there is checked. If it is identical to the one being added, then nothing is done. Since the time-stamp
is truncated to the last hour, this ensures that the undo buffer is changed only for :write's every hour.

Set g:timeStampLeader in your ~/.vimrc to change 'Last Change: ' 
(to 'Last modified: ' for instance)

Use :NOMOD to force the time-stamp to be not updated.
Use :MOD to change it back.

PS: The update only works if the string 'Last Change: ' is found somewhere
in the first 20 lines of the file. Only the first found occurence is processed.
